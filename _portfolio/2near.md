title: "Explainable AI for clinical decision support"
excerpt: "NEAR (Neural-imputed Explainable and Adaptive Risk score) is a Clinical Decision Support System that provides a risk score for cardiac events based on neural networks. The impact of different features on the final score is described through the use of SHAP, a tool for explainability of machine learning models."

Clinical Decision Support Systems provide fundamental suggestions to clinicians. However, to be effectively integrated in the clinical operations, these suggestions need to be understood and trusted by experts in the field. To this end, we implemented NEAR (Neural-imputed Explainable and Adaptive Risk score), a score predictor for cardiac events based on neural networks. To motivate the suggestions of the system, we employ SHAP, a tool for explainability that provides the impact of each input feature on the final result. Through this tool, we design a simplified models where each feature is related to the output through an equation, thus allowing for increased explainability.
