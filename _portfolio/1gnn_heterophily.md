title: "Graph Neural Networks on heterophilous graphs"
excerpt: "Heterophilous graphs represent a challenging scenario for GNNs. In this work, we better characterize the relation between heterophily and GNN performance by defining a new metric. Moreover, we define two new GNN architectures to improve performance on heterophilous graphs, GATH and GCNH."

In heterophilous graphs, nodes tend to connect with nodes with different labels and this represents a hard scenario for GNNs. However, GNNs can still perform well on some heterophilous graphs, and there is little knowledge about the relation between GNN performance and graph heterophily. This work investigates the problem and defines a new metric to characterize a graph property that is related to GCN performance.

Moreover, we define and test two new GNN models, GATH and GCNH, that incorporate designs to improve performance on heterophilous graphs. On node classification, the two models achieve competitive results with the state-of-the-art architectures.
