In heterophilous graphs, nodes tend to connect with nodes with different labels and this represents a hard scenario for GNNs. However, GNNs can still perform well on some heterophilous graphs, and there is little knowledge about the relation between GNN performance and graph heterophily. This work investigates the problem and defines a new metric to characterize a graph property that is related to GCN performance.

Moreover, we define and test a new GNN model, GCNH, that incorporates designs to improve performance on heterophilous graphs. On node classification, this model achieves competitive results compared to the state-of-the-art architectures.
