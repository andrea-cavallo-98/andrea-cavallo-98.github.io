I am a PhD student at [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/) under the supervision of [Dr. Elvin Isufi](https://sites.google.com/site/elvinisufihp/). I work on learning and processing over **dynamic (graph) data**.

Previously, I worked in the [SmartData@PoliTo](https://smartdata.polito.it/) reseach center, where I applied **Graph Machine Learning** techniques to network traffic analysis.

For my Master Thesis, I did a research internship in the AI4Sec team of the Huawei Munich Research Center, where I worked on Graph Machine Learning with applications for anomaly detection and heterophilous graphs. 

I hold a M.Sc. in Computer Engineering, Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics from [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/index.php?lang=en). During my studies, I have worked on projects dealing with the basics of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing.

I was part of [Alta Scuola Politecnica](https://www.asp-poli.it/), an excellence program involving the top 150 students from Politecnico di Torino and Politecnico di Milano. During the program, I worked on a project focused on applying **Explainable AI** to a Clinical Decision Support System.
