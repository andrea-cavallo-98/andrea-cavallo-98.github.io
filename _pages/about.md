I hold a M.Sc. in Computer Engineering, Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics from [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/index.php?lang=en). During my studies, I have worked on projects dealing with the basics of Machine Learning and Deep Learning, Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing.

For my Master Thesis, I did a research internship in the AI4Sec team of the Huawei Munich Research Center, where I worked on Graph Machine Learning with applications to anomaly detection and heterophilous graphs. 

I am passionate about Deep Learning research and its latest developments and I am looking for opportunities to jump into this world.
